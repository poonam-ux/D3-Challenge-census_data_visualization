# D3-Challenge_Data_Journalism

### Background:

You’re at a data visualization position for a major metro paper and tasked with analyzing the current trends shaping people’s lives, as well as creating charts, graphs, and interactive elements to help readers understand your findings.

The editor wants to run a series of feature stories about the health risks facing particular demographics. The current data set (from the U.S. Census Bureau and the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System) includes data on rates of income, obesity, poverty, etc. for each state.

## D3 Dabbler:

* You need to create a scatter plot between two of the data variables such as Healthcare vs. Poverty or Smokers vs. Age.
Using the D3 techniques, create a scatter plot that represents each state with circle elements.

Default axes with tooltips:

* Pull in the data from data.csv by using the d3.csv function. 
* Include state abbreviations in the circles.
* Create and situate your axes and labels to the left and bottom of the chart.

## Bonus:

* Multiple labels to choose from: 

Place additional labels in your scatter plot and give them click events so that your users can decide which data to display. Animate the transitions for your circles’ locations as well as the range of your axes.

Multiple labels for Xaxis and Yaxis:

* Incorporate d3-tip:

While the ticks on the axes allow us to infer approximate values for each circle, it’s impossible to determine the true value without adding another layer of data. Add tooltips to your circles and display each tooltip with the data that the user has selected.
